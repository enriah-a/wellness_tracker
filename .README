# 🧠 Personal Wellness Agent (Python)

A local, agentic Python application that helps improve daily wellness by tracking **protein intake from Indian meals**, adjusting nutrition for a **Vata body type**, and **reducing stress** using Samsung Watch data — all using **free tools and APIs only**.

This is a hobby project focused on learning **agentic application design** (observe → reason → act).

## ✨ Features

### 🍽️ Protein Tracking (Typically Indian Meals)

* Log daily meals (e.g., idli, dal, paneer, roti)
* Estimate protein intake - currently hardcoded, but eventually will move to pull from a reliable database
* Track daily and weekly protein totals

### 🌿 Vata-Friendly Nutrition Suggestions

* Rule-based Ayurveda-inspired logic
* Detects imbalances 
* Suggests warm, easy-to-digest, protein-rich Indian meals

### 🧘 Stress Monitoring & Breathing Nudges

* Reads stress data exported from **Samsung Health (Watch 5)**
* Detects moderate or high stress levels
* Suggests quick breathing exercises to reduce stress

---

## 🧠 Agentic Design

The app follows a simple agent loop:

```
Observe  →  Reason  →  Act
```

* **Observe:** meals, stress data
* **Reason:** protein targets, Vata rules, stress thresholds
* **Act:** nutrition advice, breathing exercises, reminders

This keeps the system modular and easy to extend.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

All tools are **free** and run locally:

* Python 3.10+
* SQLite (local storage)
* Pandas
* CSV / JSON file inputs
* Optional:

  * Streamlit (dashboard)
  * Rich (better CLI output)
  * Telegram Bot API (notifications)

### Meal Logging

Meals can be logged via:

* CLI input
* JSON / CSV file
* (Future) UI or chatbot

Example:

```
Breakfast: 2 idli + sambar
Lunch: dal chawal
Dinner: paneer sabzi + roti
```

---

### Stress Data

* Export stress data from **Samsung Health**
* Place CSV/JSON files in `data/stress_exports/`
* The agent reads the latest available data

---

## 🧘 Breathing Exercises (Examples)

* 4–6 breathing
* Box breathing
* 1-minute grounding technique

Triggered automatically when stress is moderate or high.
